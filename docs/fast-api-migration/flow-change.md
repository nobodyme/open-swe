# End-to-end flow: before (`langgraph dev` / langgraph-api) vs now (`agent_runtime`)

**Scope.** How a request travels through the system — trigger → webapp → runtime →
executor → Postgres → SSE → UI — on `main` (Elastic-licensed `langgraph-api`
behind `langgraph dev`/`langgraph up`) and on `feat/fastapi-runtime` (MIT
`agent_runtime/` behind plain uvicorn). The application layer (`agent/`, `ui/`)
is deliberately unchanged; what changed is everything behind `LANGGRAPH_URL`.

---

## The topology, before and after

Both worlds are a **single process** in dev, with the FastAPI webapp living
*inside* the runtime server and `LANGGRAPH_URL` pointing back at the same
socket. What flipped is who owns the front door:

| | Before (`main`) | Now (`feat/fastapi-runtime`) |
|---|---|---|
| Boot command | `make dev` → `uv run langgraph dev` | `make dev` → Docker Postgres + `uvicorn agent_runtime.app:app --reload` |
| Front process | `langgraph-api` server (Elastic-2.0, from `langgraph-cli[inmem]`) | `agent_runtime/app.py` (FastAPI, MIT-only closure) |
| Webapp mounting | `langgraph.json` `http.app: agent.webapp:app` — langgraph-api mounts the webapp into itself | `app.py:172-176` — agent_runtime registers its routers first, then mounts `agent.webapp:app` at `/` as a catch-all (Starlette matches in registration order, so runtime paths win; webhooks/dashboard/OAuth fall through) |
| Dev persistence | `langgraph-runtime-inmem`: in-memory checkpointer, store, and run queue | One Postgres for everything: MIT `AsyncPostgresSaver` (checkpoints), `AsyncPostgresStore` (store), plus agent_runtime's own tables `rt_thread` / `rt_run` / `rt_thread_event` (`agent_runtime/schema.sql`) |
| Prod persistence | `langgraph up`: Postgres + Redis + durable queue + worker pool | Same single Postgres; single process enforced by a `pg_try_advisory_lock` at boot (`app.py:43-71`) |
| Run execution | Durable queue; workers poll and pick up runs; interrupted runs auto-resume | `asyncio.create_task` in-process (`executor.py`); no durable queue; a 500ms pickup delay (`AGENT_RUNTIME_PICKUP_DELAY_MS`) models the old queue's latency |
| Streaming fanout | Broker (in-mem queue in dev / Redis on platform), SSE replay + tail | Durable event log in `rt_thread_event` + in-process fanout (`streams.py`), SSE replay-then-tail with seq/ord dedupe |
| Crons | Platform scheduler inside langgraph-api | APScheduler + Postgres-persisted crons (`cron_scheduler.py`) |
| `.env` handling | `.env` overrides the shell | Shell wins (`load_dotenv(override=False)`, `app.py:149-155`) |

## Flow 1 — a trigger becomes an agent run (Slack mention, Linear comment, GitHub PR comment)

This flow's *edges* are identical in both worlds up to the runtime boundary;
only the box behind `LANGGRAPH_URL` changed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Ext as Slack / Linear / GitHub
    participant Webapp as agent.webapp (FastAPI)
    participant RT as runtime behind LANGGRAPH_URL
    participant DB as Postgres
    participant Graph as deep agent graph
    participant SB as sandbox

    Ext->>Webapp: POST /webhooks/… (signature verified)
    Webapp->>Webapp: derive deterministic thread_id
    Webapp->>RT: SDK threads.create(if_exists="do_nothing")
    Webapp->>RT: dispatch.create_durable_run → runs.create(multitask_strategy="interrupt", durability="sync", webhook=…?token=)
    RT->>DB: persist thread + run rows
    RT->>Graph: execute (per-thread arbitration first)
    Graph->>SB: ensure_sandbox_for_thread → shell/git/gh
    Graph->>DB: checkpoint before each step (durability="sync")
    RT-->>DB: append wire events (event log)
    RT->>Webapp: POST /webhooks/run-complete?token=… on ANY terminal state
    Webapp->>Ext: reply in source channel (Slack/Linear/GitHub)
```

Step by step, with where each hop lives:

1. **Webhook in.** GitHub/Linear/Slack POST to routes on `agent/webapp.py` /
   `agent/webhooks/*`. Signatures verified
   (`utils/github_comments.py:verify_github_signature` etc.). A deterministic
   `thread_id` is derived so follow-ups land on the same thread.
2. **Dispatch.** Every trigger funnels through the single contract
   `agent/dispatch.py:create_durable_run` → `client.runs.create(...)` with
   `multitask_strategy="interrupt"`, `durability="sync"`,
   `if_not_exists="create"`, and a completion `webhook` URL carrying a
   verification `?token=`. The SDK call is plain HTTP back into the same
   process (`LANGGRAPH_URL` → same socket).
3. **Runtime accepts the run.**
   - *Before:* langgraph-api wrote the run into its **durable queue**; a
     worker later polled it up. Multitask arbitration, checkpointing, and
     stream publication were internal to the licensed server.
   - *Now:* `agent_runtime/routers/runs.py` → `RunExecutor`
     (`agent_runtime/executor.py`). A per-thread `asyncio.Lock` arbitrates
     multitask (`interrupt` halts the active run at its last sync checkpoint
     and starts the new one with full history; `reject` refuses; `rollback`/
     `enqueue` are not implemented → HTTP 400). After a deliberate ~500ms
     pickup delay (models the old queue latency — load-bearing for Slack
     follow-up coalescing), the run executes as an `asyncio.create_task`.
4. **Graph execution.** The executor resolves the graph factory from
   `langgraph.json` via `agent_runtime/registry.py` (same
   `get_agent`/`get_reviewer_agent`/… factories as before), attaches the
   shared `AsyncPostgresSaver` as the compiled checkpointer, and iterates
   `graph.astream(..., subgraphs=True, durability="sync")`. Checkpoints land
   in Postgres **before** each step — same guarantee as before, now via the
   MIT checkpointer.
5. **Mid-run messages** (unchanged app mechanics): a new Slack/Linear message
   for a busy thread is queued in the store; `check_message_queue_before_model`
   middleware drains it into the conversation before the next model call. The
   arbitration + pickup delay preserve the coalescing window the platform
   queue used to provide (pinned by the `slack_debounce` e2e).
6. **Completion.** On *every* terminal state (success, error, cancel, orphan
   sweep) `agent_runtime/webhooks.py` POSTs the run payload to
   `COMPLETION_WEBHOOK_URL?token=…` → `agent/completion.py` verifies the token
   and posts the Slack/Linear/GitHub reply. Before, langgraph-api's webhook
   feature did this POST; the payload fields the app reads (`status`,
   `thread_id`, `run_id`) are contract-identical.

**The one semantic change in this flow:** crash recovery. Before, an in-flight
run survived a process restart — the durable queue re-picked it up and it
auto-resumed. Now there is **no durable queue and no auto-resume** (D3): on
the next boot `executor.sweep_orphans_on_boot()` marks orphaned runs `error`
and fires exactly one failure webhook, so the user is told and must
**re-trigger**; the re-triggered run resumes from the last sync checkpoint, so
no work is lost — but it doesn't continue on its own. (Chaos suite pins this:
`tests/chaos/`.)

---

## Flow 2 — the dashboard UI (browser → SSE and back)

The browser never talks to the runtime directly; everything goes through the
dashboard proxy in `agent/dashboard/thread_api.py` (and `review_chat_api.py`),
which owns auth (the `osw_session` cookie from GitHub OAuth) and then forwards
to `LANGGRAPH_URL`. This proxy layout is identical in both worlds.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as ui/ (StreamProvider, @langchain/react)
    participant Proxy as agent/dashboard (auth: osw_session)
    participant RT as runtime
    participant DB as Postgres

    UI->>Proxy: POST /commands {method:"run.start", …}
    Proxy->>RT: POST /threads/{id}/commands (enriched, forwarded verbatim)
    RT->>RT: executor starts run (same path as Flow 1 step 3+)
    UI->>Proxy: POST /stream/events {channels, since}
    Proxy->>RT: POST /threads/{id}/stream/events
    RT->>DB: replay rt_thread_event rows ≥ since
    RT-->>UI: SSE v2 envelopes {type, event_id, seq, method, params:{namespace, data}} — replay, then live tail
    UI->>Proxy: GET /state · POST /history
    Proxy->>RT: forwarded → checkpointer-backed state/history
```

- **Send:** the UI's `StreamProvider` submits via `run.start` on
  `POST /threads/{id}/commands`. Now handled by
  `agent_runtime/routers/commands.py` — which implements **only**
  `run.start`; any other v2 method (e.g. the SDK's native `input.respond`
  interrupt-answer) returns `invalid_argument`. The old server accepted the
  full v2 method set. The open-swe UI doesn't use `respond()` today (resumes
  go through `run.start`), so this is latent, not live.
- **Receive:** token chunks and value updates flow as v2 envelopes over SSE.
  - *Before:* langgraph-api's broker produced the v2 stream.
  - *Now:* the executor normalizes each `astream` item into a `WireEvent`
    (`agent_runtime/streams.py`), **persists it to `rt_thread_event`** (the
    durable event log), and fans it out in-process to live SSE subscribers.
    Reconnects resume via body `since` (v2) or `Last-Event-ID` (SDK stream
    endpoints, redis-style `<ms>-<n>` ids) — replay from Postgres, then tail.
    The Phase-0 golden transcripts recorded from `langgraph dev` are the wire
    spec (`tests/contract/golden/`).
- **Known wire gap:** the v2 envelope's `params.namespace` is currently
  hardcoded to `[]` (`streaming.py:49` calls `to_v2_envelope(event)` without a
  namespace even though the executor streams `subgraphs=True`), so
  subagent-scoped events can't be attributed by the UI's `SubagentActivity` /
  `useToolCalls(stream, {namespace})`. Untested by the parity suite (the only
  stream golden has no subgraph events). See "Regressions" below.
- **State/history:** `GET /threads/{id}/state` and `POST /threads/{id}/history`
  are served from the MIT checkpointer (`aget_state` / state history) instead
  of langgraph-api's internal implementation; shapes are golden-pinned.

## Flow 3 — data at rest

| Data | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Threads + metadata | langgraph-api internal tables (inmem in dev) | `rt_thread` (JSONB metadata, `@>` search with nested keys, status, sort, select) — `threads_repo.py` |
| Runs | internal queue + run tables | `rt_run` — `runs_repo.py` |
| Stream events | broker (ephemeral in dev; Redis on platform) | `rt_thread_event` — durable, is *the* replay source |
| Checkpoints | langgraph-api checkpointer (inmem dev / Postgres platform) | MIT `AsyncPostgresSaver`, attached as the compiled checkpointer |
| Store (profiles, team settings, plans, queues, feedback state…) | langgraph-api store; in-graph `get_store()` and HTTP `/store` hit the same store | MIT `AsyncPostgresStore` — **one instance** shared by the HTTP router and in-graph `get_store()` (identity-tested) |
| Crons | platform scheduler state | Postgres-persisted, fired by APScheduler (`cron_scheduler.py`); one-shot thread wakeups use `end_time` |
| TTL | `langgraph.json` `checkpointer.ttl.strategy="delete"` (would drop whole threads; a no-op under dev's inmem) | `ttl_sweep.py`: deletes checkpoint data + events, **keeps** `rt_thread`/`rt_run` (thread metadata is load-bearing app state) — a swept thread reads like a never-run thread |

---

## Flow 4 — crons and scheduled wakeups

1. `agent/tools/schedule_thread_wakeup.py` (and analyzer/dashboard schedules)
   call `crons.create` / `crons.create_for_thread(end_time, timezone)`.
2. *Before:* langgraph-api's scheduler fired them. *Now:* `CronScheduler`
   stores the payload in Postgres and APScheduler fires it → rebuilds a run
   body → same executor path as Flow 1.
3. **Known gap:** the wakeup purge calls
   `crons.search(metadata={"kind": "thread_wakeup"})`, but `CronSearchBody`
   (`agent_runtime/models.py:108-112`) has no `metadata` field — the filter is
   silently dropped and the search returns *all* crons. Only the additional
   `end_time < now` guard (wakeups are the only crons with `end_time` today)
   prevents the purge from deleting analyzer/schedule crons. Fragile; see
   "Regressions".

---

## What did NOT change

- Everything in `agent/`: webhook handling, thread-id derivation, dispatch
  contract, middleware stack, tools, sandbox lifecycle, GitHub/Slack/Linear
  auth, dashboard routes, completion replies.
- The UI and its wire protocol (`@langchain/react` v2 envelopes) — golden-pinned.
- The SDK: the app still uses `langgraph_sdk` clients against `LANGGRAPH_URL`.
- Checkpoint-before-each-step durability (`durability="sync"`).

## Behavioral differences visible in the flows (regressions & divergences)

Ranked; the full ledger is `tests/contract/golden/README.md` and the audit in
this doc's sibling `COMPLETENESS.md`.

1. **No auto-resume of in-flight runs** after crash/restart — orphans →
   `error` + failure webhook; user must re-trigger (resumes from checkpoint).
2. **Single process only** — advisory lock fails a second worker; no
   horizontal scaling, one point of failure.
3. **`crons.search` metadata filter silently ignored** (Flow 4 gap) — the
   wakeup purge currently survives on the `end_time` guard alone.
4. **v2 stream `params.namespace` always `[]`** (Flow 2 gap) — subagent
   activity attribution in the UI cannot work until the namespace is threaded
   through `WireEvent` → `to_v2_envelope`.
5. `/commands` accepts only `run.start`; native SDK interrupt-answering
   (`input.respond`) would 400 (unused by this UI today).
6. Platform surface with no app consumer simply doesn't exist anymore:
   assistants CRUD/versioning, thread copy, stateless runs, `runs.wait`,
   `update_state`/checkpoint forking (time-travel), `rollback`/`enqueue`
   multitask strategies, run-level `stream_mode="events"`, client-controlled
   `subgraphs`, store `ttl`/`index` params, runtime-level auth hooks.
7. Dev experience: LangGraph Studio and the zero-dependency in-memory
   quickstart are gone (`make dev` needs Docker Postgres); the
   `langgraph up` / LangGraph Platform deploy path is removed; `.env` no
   longer overrides the shell; TTL sweep semantics changed (see Flow 3).
